It is powered by [Controller Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/Riders.Controller.Hook/blob/master/README-HOOK.md).  

This is a fallback in case you have issues with [Custom Mapping for Controller Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/Riders.Controller.Hook/blob/master/README-CUSTOM.md).

It is recommended you use [Post Process for Controller Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/Riders.Controller.Hook/blob/master/README-POSTPROCESS.md) with this mod to add support for deadzones and swapping triggers.
