# About Custom Mapping for Sonic Riders

This mod allows for remapping of controller inputs, supporting:  
- XInput & DirectInput Controllers.  
- Real-Time Hotplugging (Connect Controller Mid-Game).  
- Multiple Mappings Per Key.  
- Using simultaneous controllers at once (e.g. Mouse + Keyboard, Two Controllers).  
- Inverting button mappings/presses.

It is powered by [Controller Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/Riders.Controller.Hook/blob/master/README-HOOK.md).  

It is recommended you use [Post Process for Controller Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/Riders.Controller.Hook/blob/master/README-POSTPROCESS.md) with this mod to add support for deadzones and swapping triggers.
